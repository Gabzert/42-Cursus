# This is my personal repo for all 42 projects

In summary the projects are:
* **Libft**, a clone of LibC:
The project allows you to familiarize yourself with the basics of programming in C 
by creating your own library that can be reused in future projects.
Libft aims to recreate a set of functions that replicate the 
behavior of standard C library functions and introduce 
additional functions.
Skills learned are: ls syntax of C, variables, loops, the 
conditionals, functions, recursiveness, instructions, calculus and expressions, 
comparison operators, standard and advanced types, manipulation of 
strings, structures, inclusions and libraries, allocation and release of 
memory, linked lists, trees.
* **get_next_line**, a clone of readline:
The goal of this project is to create a function that can read a 
file or standard input line by line, using repeated calls to the 
get_next_line() function. The function returns the readline as a 
dynamically allocated string. If there is nothing else to read or if an 
an error, the function returns NULL. 
The design allows customizations through the size of the buffer 
(i.e., the characters read at each function call) and offers a bonus part 
to improve functionality by handling multiple file descriptors 
simultaneously.
* **ft_printf**, a clone of printf:
  The goal of the project is to recreate the functionality of the original printf() functionoriginal, handling several format conversions. The function will have tohandle the following conversions: c, s, p, d, i, u, x, X, % and, with bonuses, alsothe following flags: '-', '0', '.', ' ', '#', '+'.
* **Born2BeRoot**, First Virtual Machine:
system calls, filesystem access and management, creation,execution and management of processes; terminal functionality;network communication: DNS resolution.
IP addresses, subnets, default routing, local area network structure; 
Fundamentals of system administration: installation of the 
Linux operating system, setting up system security: access, users, 
storage, installation of network services such as mail, dns, web server
* **Push_swap**, software that can apply the most efficient sorting algorithm 
efficient to a disordered structure:
C Bases
search, sort, insert, delete, applied to: arrays, listslinked, trees depending on the strategy chosen for resolution
* **Pipex**, software that can emulate the operation of | and the 
terminal redirection:C Basics
system calls, filesystem access and management, creation,execution and management of processes; communications between processes: pipes; 
device management and ioctl, terminal functionality;
* **Fdf**, first minimal 3D rendering software("iron wire"):
C Basics
Image management, RGB structure of an image, manipulation 
of areas, drawing on an image, interaction with the 
windows and receiving user events and mouse input, 
programming with callbacks.

* **Minishell**, simplified clone of the bash shell (**not in this repo at the moment**):
C bash
system calls, filesystem access and management, creation, 
execution and management of processes; communications between processes: pipes and 
signals; terminal functionality; byte ordering.
Algorithms for searching, sorting, inserting, deleting, 
balancing, applied to: arrays, linked lists, trees.

* **Philosophers**, software capable of managing n parallel processes that share 
common resources:
C Bases
Balancing algohym applied to: arrays, linked lists, trees. Machine 
Finite state and asynchronous management
Multi-threaded programs, Posix threads, thread concurrency, mutex.

* **Cub3d**, first-person game requiring ray-casting implementation (**not in this repo, check [@ggiannit](https://github.com/skyheis) for the files**) :
C basics
Image handling, RGB structure of an image, manipulationof areas, drawing on an image, interaction with the 
windows and receiving user events and keyboard and mouse input, 
programming with callbacks and event loops.

* **NetPractice**, a series of exercises aimed at the apprehension of the basics 
related to network administration
IP addresses, subnets, default routing, local network structure, 
host-to-host connectivity and network services;

* **CPP Module 00-09**, 10 projects aimed at learning the C++ language and 
object-oriented development techniques:
classes, namespaces, constructors and destructors, memory management in 
C++, inheritance, abstraction, overloading, templates, types, tools in the 
C++ standard library, C++ containers
